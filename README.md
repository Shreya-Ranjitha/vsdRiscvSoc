# VSD RISC-V SoC Labs

## Introduction

This repository documents my step-by-step learning journey in the VSD RISC-V System-on-Chip (SoC) lab series. The goal is to gain hands-on experience with the RISC-V toolchain, cross-compiling C code for the RISC-V architecture, analyzing binaries, and running/debugging on emulators like QEMU and GDB.

Each week, I will add new tasks and their solutions, including:
- Toolchain setup and verification
- Minimal "Hello, RISC-V!" C program compilation
- Assembly and disassembly analysis
- ELF to HEX conversion
- Register and ABI understanding
- Debugging with GDB
- Running bare-metal code on QEMU and Spike

This README will serve as a complete log of commands, code, outputs, screenshots, and explanations, making it a helpful reference for anyone new to RISC-V labs.
